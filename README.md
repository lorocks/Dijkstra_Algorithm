# Dijkstra_Algorithm
The following implementation uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path of a point object in a 2D graph.

## Installing Dependencies
```bash
# Install numpy
  pip install numpy
# Install opencv
  pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the Code
The code can be run using any method.

The user will be prompted to add the type of padding to be used, 'true' or 'rounded'.
Enter 'true' for true padding, and for rounded paddings type anything random.

Next, enter the padding distance, default value is 0

Finally, enter 'y' or 'n' to choose whether a video should be recorded.
'y' to make a video recording, 'n' to not record.

The algorithm will execute and then display a video if recording is enabled.


## Video Display
After code execution, the algorithm and backtracking will be displayed as a video using OpenCV.
A new video window will pop open and display it.


## Execution Time
When recording is enabled, the execution time will be around 1min.
When recoding is disabled, the execution time will be around 6sec.
